The project also includes a built-in solving algorithm, that will hint you in the right direction or show you the way.\r\n\r\n## Project Architecture\r\nThis project was built as a part of Java Algorithms course in the College of Management with Nissim Brami.\r\nThe project includes various design patterns, such as Observer Pattern, Strategy pattern and Adapter Pattern.\r\nIt implements a solving algorithm using BFS (Best First Search) and DFS algorithms.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n[Javadoc](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hagay3/Maze3D-Project/blob/master/javadoc/index.html)\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n[Demo - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DBQmUz4n6s)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/hagay3/Maze3D-Project.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse the scripts under directory \"jars\" for the relevant operating system.\r\n\r\nFor example in windows 64 bit use cmd:\r\n```\r\ncd jars\r\nrunWin64.bat\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![main](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagay3/Maze3D-Project/master/images/main.png)\r\n\r\n![cli](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagay3/Maze3D-Project/master/images/CLI.png)\r\n\r\n![gen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagay3/Maze3D-Project/master/images/Generate.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
